#summary HOWTO: Use the HAWG Repository
=HOWTO: Use the HAWG Repository=
The following page describes how to setup and get started with using the HAWG stock assessment repository. The repository is a version control system for stock assessment code, allowing multiple users to collaborate on a common assessment project by sharing and synchronising their code. In addition, it also provides version control on a line-by-line basis - all versions are saved, and its always possible to go back!

== System Requirements ==
You will need the following software to use the HAWG repository. 
  * R (at least version 2.13.0 or greater) for your system. [http://cran.r-project.org/ Available here].
  * An SVN (subversion) client. For Windows users, we recommend [http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/ TortoiseSVN]. Linux users will typically have access to such a client through their package distribution system.
  * Some way to write and edit R code. For Windows, try [http://rstudio.org/ RStudio] or [http://sourceforge.net/projects/tinn-r/ Tinn-R]. For Linux, you have [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi Vi]

== Getting the Code ==

A nice introduction on how to download code from the repository using TortoiseSVN has been written by the [http://code.google.com/p/mseflr/ mseflr] people and is available from http://code.google.com/p/mseflr/wiki/UsingTortoiseSVN. 

The "trunk" URL for this project is http://hawg.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ - this contains the most recent version. If you intend to work on the files, you should "checkout" from this directory - otherwise, if you're just curious, you should "export" from this directory(right-click on a folder, and select TortoiseSVN/Export). The difference is relatively minor however, and you can't do too much damage by choosing the wrong option.

If you would like to download snap-shot versions of the assessment to run yourself (e.g. from HAWG 2009), use http://hawg.googlecode.com/svn/tags/ as the URL instead. If you would like to get everything, including both the most recent version (the "trunk") and all snap-shots,  use http://hawg.googlecode.com/svn/.

Finally, there is a wee trap for beginners when logging in for the first time - make sure that you use the password for the project that googlecode supplies you - not your login password to google itself! This is detailed on in the [http://code.google.com/p/mseflr/wiki/UsingTortoiseSVN mseflr] page under "Project member checkout".



== Working Directory ==
All code is designed to be run with the ./Stock/ directory as the working directory. Changes from this will cause code to break - I wish there was a nice way around this, but there isn't really, unfortunately. All paths should be setup relative to this directory.

	
==Output Figures==

The common assessment module does not specify the type of output format - this is left 
up to the user to decide. If no device is configured, all of the graphs will be displayed
in the graphics window. If the user wishes to save the graphs, eg to windows metafiles, png or PDF, they should configure the output device before sourcing the common module, and close it afterwards. eg

{{{
png("figures - %02d.png",units = "px", pointsize = 10, bg = "white")
#<Plotting scripts>
dev.off()
}}}
