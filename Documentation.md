# SAM Documentation #

Work has begun to provide public documentation of the SAM assessment model. The reader is referred to the http://www.stockassessment.org webpage, where SAM is hosted, and the associated  [wiki](http://code.google.com/p/stockassessment/wiki/modelDescription?tm=6).

# FLSAM Documentation #

The FLSAM package is documented internally using the R help system. All functions have (or should have - if you find something missing, please report it!) help files.

An overview of the FLSAM package can be found by typing the following command at the R command line:
```R

help(package="FLSAM")
```
The FLSAM "[Cheatsheet](Cheatsheet.md)" also provides an overview of all available functionality.

Alternatively, help on an indvidual function can be accessed from the R command line e.g. to get help on the FLSAM method, type
```R

help("FLSAM")
```

or

```R

?FLSAM
```
